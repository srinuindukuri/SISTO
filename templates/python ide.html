                    <br> * When you install Python, IDLE is also installed by default. This makes it easy to get started in Python. Its major features include the Python shell window(interactive interpreter), auto-completion, syntax highlighting, smart
                    indentation, and a basic integrated debugger.
                    <br>
                    <br> * IDLE is a decent IDE for learning as it's lightweight and simple to use. However, it's not for optimum for larger projects.

                    <br> * Spyder is an open-source IDE usually used for scientific development.
                    <br>
                    <br> * The easiest way to get up and running up with Spyder is by installing Anaconda distribution. If you don't know, Anaconda is a popular distribution for data science and machine learning. The Anaconda distribution includes hundreds
                    of packages including NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib and so on.
                    <br>
                    <br> * Spyder has some great features such as autocompletion, debugging and iPython shell. However, it lacks in features compared to PyCharm.
